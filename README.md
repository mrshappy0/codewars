<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=./Create-Phone-Number.js) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from ./Create-Phone-Number.js -->
```js
createPhoneNumber = (numbers, n = numbers.join("")) =>
  `(${n.slice(0, 3)}) ${n.slice(3, 6)}-${n.slice(6, 10)}`;

#### [Adjacent Repeated Words in a String](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5245a9138ca049e9a10007b8) | [Solution](https://github.com/mrshappy0/codewars/blob/master/Adjacent-repeated-words-in-a-string.js)

**Problem** (6kyu):

_You know how sometimes you write the the same word twice in a sentence, but then don't notice that it happened? For example, you've been distracted for a second. Did you notice that *"the"* is doubled in the first sentence of this description?

As as aS you can see, it's not easy to spot those errors, especially if words differ in case, like *"as"* at the beginning of the sentence.

Write a function that counts the number of sections repeating the same word (case insensitive). The occurence of two or more equal words next after each other count as one._

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=./Adjacent-repeated-words-in-a-string.js) -->
<!-- The below code snippet is automatically added from ./Adjacent-repeated-words-in-a-string.js -->
```js
countAdjacentPairs = (searchString, p1 = /\b(\w+)\b\s+\1\b\s*(\1\b\s)*/gi) =>
  searchString === "" ? 0 : (searchString.match(p1) || []).length;
```
